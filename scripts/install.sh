# The binary is self-contained apart from the files it downloads on first run
# (model, voices, ONNX Runtime) into ~/.cache/kokoro-rs, so installing is just
# a matter of copying one file onto PATH.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install.sh                  # install to ~/.local/bin
#   PREFIX=/usr/local scripts/install.sh  # install to /usr/local/bin
#   BINDIR=/opt/bin scripts/install.sh    # install to an exact directory
